# About Me

I’ve probably forgotten most of the Java syntax—it’s only been half a year, though. Since I’ve been focusing on Godot, which uses GDScript and Python, for developing our school project and working with FastAPI, my programming knowledge now revolves around those types of syntax. Don’t get me wrong—I still know how to program; it’s just the syntax that I’ve forgotten.

Currently, I’m busy creating different game templates in Godot to prepare for the upcoming game development course in the second semester.

On another note, I’ve started learning pixel art :D! I’m currently exploring Aseprite but having a hard time transitioning from Piskel, which I got too used to.
