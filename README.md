I specialize in **Java**; my knowledge of this programming language ranges from the basics to GUI applications and MySQL databases connections.

I can also use **Python** to a certain extent like making automated tasks and telegram bots.

And lastly, I also specialize in **C#**, which is my primary language for game development. Since it's quite similar to Java, I find it easy to work with.
